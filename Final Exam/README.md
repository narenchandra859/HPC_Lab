1. 
a. Write an OpenMP program to perform addition of two arrays A & B store the result in the array C (Using Scheduling concept)
b. Write a CUDA program to print the message “Hello World” and demonstrate blocks by varying NUM_BLOCKS to different sizes.

2. 
a. Write an OpenMP program which performs C=A+B  & D=A-B in separate blocks/sections where A,B,C & D  are arrays.
b. Write a MPI program to send the message from a process whose rank=3 to all other remaining processes.

3. 
a. Write an OpenMP program to add all the elements of two arrays A & B each of size 1000 and store their sum in a variable using reduction clause.
b. Write a CUDA program to multiply two matrices.

4. 
a. Write an OpenMP program  to multiply two matrices A & B and find the resultant matrix C
b. Write a MPI program to send the message from a process whose rank=3 to all other remaining processes.

5. 
a. Write an OpenMP program to find the number of processes, number of threads, etc (the environment information).
b. Write a MPI program scatter the information to different processes (Consider at least Six Processes).

6. 
a. Write an OpenMP program to find the largest element in an array using critical section.
b. Write a CUDA program for adding two vectors.

7. 
a. Write an OpenMP program to show how thread private clause works.
b. Write a MPI program to find sum of 'n' integers on 'p' processors using  point-to-point communication libraries call
